		<h2>iOS Work</h2>		
		<p>Late in 2009 I started to dabble in iOS development.  Maybe it was the lure of the AppStore, or the tedium of building back office web applications, I'm not sure, but iOS quickly changed from an interest into a passion.</p>
		<p>I'm currently the lead iOS developer at ChaiONE Inc.  I spend most of my days prototyping ideas and working on iPad and iPhone applications.  I pretty much live and breath this stuff :)</p>
		
		<p>If you have a small project that you'd like to get to the app store let me know (@kevinwlee) I'd love to work with you!</p>

		<h2>University Laundry</h2>
		<p>University Laundry Tracker allows you to easily track your laundry through the entire cleaning process. Using a baseball metaphor, you can follow your bundled and campus cleaners bags around the bases until they are CLEAN and back in your hands. In addition to tracking, we have added a map with the complete truck and lobby service daily schedule. By utilizing geo locations and Google Maps, you can find the truck's exact location.</p>

		<h2>Web Work</h2>		
		<p>I got my start building ASP pages back in 1999.  That progressed into 8-9 years of ASP.net consulting work.  When MVC was released I fell in love with the framework and started reading up on it's roots.  That led me to Ruby On Rails, which is where I spend most of my Web time these days.</p>
		<p>I started to dig into client-side web development in 2008, and quickly jumped on the jQuery band wagon.  That blossomed into full on javascript love.  I'm currently an organizer of the HoustonJS meetup and have been known to speak about all things javascript.</p>
